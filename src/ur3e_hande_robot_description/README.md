## ur3e_hande_robot_description

This package contains 
  - descriptions files for the hand-e robotic gripper by *Robotiq*,
  - description file for integrating the gripper to ur3e robotic arm by Universal Robotics, and
  - four configuration files to be passed when initiating the ur3e robotic arm. 


**config/hande**

Files default_kinematics.yaml, physical_parameters.yaml, and visual_parameters are created both as a part of the automated process through "MoveIt Setup Assistant" and extracting the values from hand-e user manual. 
These files contain the physical properties of the hand-e gripper and pointers to the respective design files

**config/ur3e**

Configuration files for the ur3e robot are directly copied from the humble version of the package [*Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description*](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description/tree/29e90d5095fdf4af99eba3c3eae153d7d5d769c0/config/ur3e).
These configurations are free to be adjusted. 

**meshes/hande**

These files contains designs for the hand-e robot. .dae files are directly taken from *Acutronic Robotic*'s [robotiq_modular_gripper](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/robotiq_modular_gripper/tree/4e708524e5dd20753f711686eb2cd1017a25a09e/robotiq_hande_gripper_description/meshes). These design files were not available in *Robotiq*'s github repositories.

**urdf/hande.xacro**

The description file for the hand-e gripper. This is inspired from *Acutronic Robotic*'s [robotiq_modular_gripper](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/robotiq_modular_gripper/blob/4e708524e5dd20753f711686eb2cd1017a25a09e/robotiq_hande_gripper_description/urdf/robotiq_hande.urdf.xacro) and extended to include paramters from config/hande. 

**urdf/ur_with_hande.xacro**

This file creates the description for the ur3e robot and attaches the hande gripper. Ur3e robot module is created to be directly compatible with the humble version of the the package [ur_description](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description/blob/29e90d5095fdf4af99eba3c3eae153d7d5d769c0/urdf/ur.urdf.xacro) by the following line 
```xml
<xacro:include filename="$(find ur_description)/urdf/ur_macro.xacro"/>
```

**Azure Kinect .stl**
Design for the Azure Kinect camera can be found in [Microsoft official github repo.](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/tree/5f79890933e1c81e325633152b2f2799df825b8b/assets)
