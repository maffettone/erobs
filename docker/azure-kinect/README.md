Build the docker / podman image
```bash
podman build -t azure-kinect:latest .
```

Following command executes the image without opening up the network to the host network:
```bash
podman run -it --privileged azure-kinect:latest /bin/bash -c "Xvfb :1 -screen 0 2560x1440x16 & . /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && . /root/ws/install/setup.sh && ros2 launch azure_kinect_ros_driver driver.launch.py" 
```

Following command executes the image opening up a the container to the host network. This needs testing
```bash
podman run -it --privileged --network host --ipc=host --pid=host azure-kinect:latest /bin/bash -c "Xvfb :2 -screen 0 2560x1440x16 & . /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && . /root/ws/install/setup.sh && ros2 launch azure_kinect_ros_driver driver.launch.py depth_mode:=NFOV_UNBINNED  point_cloud_in_depth_frame:=true && bash"
```

A number of parameters with respect to the Kinect camera can be set via driver.launch.py. Refer [this link](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure_Kinect_ROS_Driver/blob/6ffb95a56ee175e5020b5ee5983d7230befbb176/docs/usage.md) for the complete list of options.
